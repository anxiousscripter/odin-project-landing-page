# odin-project-landing-page

This project is a basic landing page built as part of the curriculum from The Odin Project. The goal of the assignment was to recreate a provided design using HTML and CSS, based on a reference image and a style guide supplied with the project.

# Project Description

The landing page was created from scratch using semantic HTML and custom CSS. The provided assets included a visual reference of the final layout and a style guide outlining font sizes, font weights, and color values. No JavaScript or external libraries were required or used.

The page layout includes a header section, a hero area, informational sections, and a call-to-action, all styled to match the reference as closely as possible.

# Skills Practiced

This project helped solidify the following concepts:

Structuring content with semantic HTML
Using Flexbox for layout and alignment
Applying typography and color styles from a design guide
Managing spacing, sizing, and alignment
Organizing CSS for clarity and maintainability

# Technologies Used

# Notes

This project is not meant to be fully responsive or production-ready unless extended beyond the original assignment requirements. The primary objective was to practice translating a static design into working code.
